            Hi, I'm Brandon and I'm a media arts student from the School of Interactive Arts & Technology at Simon Fraser University. I love to communicate ideas visually through video and motion graphics, engaging the viewer as much as I can while peaking their interest as they watch through videos. For me, the best tool for educating is visual representation; and that's why I want to find new ways to educate people on different aspects of a concept. I'm also a big fan of video games, exercise, and Marvel.

        <p>Roaming Objects are tools that possess a digital tag. This means that when an object is signed out from the Vancouver Tool Library, digital history can be reviewed and added to via an application on mobile devices. This includes pictures, videos, geo-locations ratings, and comments.</p>
